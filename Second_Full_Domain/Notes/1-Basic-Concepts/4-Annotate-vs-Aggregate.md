# Annotate vs Aggregate in Django ORM

In Django's Object-Relational Mapping (ORM), the concepts of annotation and aggregation are used
to perform calculations and aggregations on query sets. Both annotate and aggregate functions in
Django ORM allow you to generate derived values based on the data in your database, but they differ
in how the calculations are performed. annotation adds derived fields to individual objects in a query
set, while aggregation performs calculations across the entire query set, resulting in a single
aggregated value. Both annotation and aggregation functions are powerful tools provided by Django
ORM to work with data in a more dynamic and flexible manner.

## 1. Annotation

The annotate function in Django ORM allows you to add calculated fields to each object in a query set.
It provides a way to include additional data that is not directly stored in the model but is derived from
the existing fields. Annotation does not perform any aggregation; it simply adds the annotated values
to each object in the query set. The annotated values can be used for sorting, filtering, or displaying
additional information.

### Example:

```python
from django.db.models import Count
from myapp.models import Blog, Comment

# Annotate each blog with the number of comments
blogs = Blog.objects.annotate(num_comments=Count('comments'))
for blog in blogs:
    print(blog.title, blog.num_comments)
```

In the above example, the `num_comments` field is added to each Blog object in the query set `blogs`. It
represents the count of related Comment objects associated with each blog.

## 2. Aggregation

The aggregate function in Django ORM allows you to perform calculations on a query set, producing a
single result. It enables you to compute values across multiple objects in the query set, such as
calculating the sum, average, maximum, or minimum of a specific field. Aggregation functions return
a dictionary containing the computed results.

### Example:

```python
from django.db.models import Sum
from myapp.models import Order

# Calculate the total price of all orders
total_price = Order.objects.aggregate(total=Sum('price'))
print(total_price['total'])
```

In the above example, the `Sum` aggregation is applied to the `price` field of the `Order` model. The result
is a dictionary with a single key-value pair, where the key 'total' represents the computed sum of all
order prices.
