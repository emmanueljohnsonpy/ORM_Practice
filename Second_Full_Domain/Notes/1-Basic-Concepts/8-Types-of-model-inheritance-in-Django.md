# Types of Model Inheritance in Django

In Django, model inheritance refers to the ability to create new models that inherit fields and behaviors from existing models. Django provides several types of model inheritance, each with its own characteristics and use cases. Here are the types of model inheritance in Django:

## 1. Abstract Base Classes (ABC)
An abstract base class is a model that does not generate its own database table but provides common fields and methods that can be inherited by other models. It serves as a blueprint for other models to define common fields and behaviors. To create an abstract base class, you define it with `abstract = True` in the `Meta` class.

## 2. Multi-Table Inheritance
Multi-table inheritance creates a separate database table for each model in the inheritance chain. Each model contains its own fields and inherits all the fields and methods from its parent models. This type of inheritance allows you to query and work with each model independently.

## 3. Proxy Models
Proxy models are used to create a different representation of an existing model without creating a new table in the database. They can be used to add or override methods, managers, or metadata of an existing model without modifying the original model's behavior. Proxy models are defined with `proxy = True` in the `Meta` class.

## 4. Concrete Base Classes
Concrete base classes are regular models that have their own database tables and can be instantiated. They can also be used as a base class for other models. Concrete base classes are the most straightforward form of model inheritance and behave like regular models.
