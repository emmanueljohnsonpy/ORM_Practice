# Values and Values List in Django ORM

In Django's Object-Relational Mapping (ORM), the terms `values` and `values_list` refer to methods that allow you to retrieve data from the database in a structured manner. Both `values()` and `values_list()` methods are useful when you only need a subset of fields from your model instances, and you want the result in a structured format for further processing or serialization.

## 1. Values

The `values()` method in Django ORM allows you to retrieve specific fields from a model as a QuerySet of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents an object and its field values. You can pass the field names as arguments to the `values()` method to specify which fields you want to include in the result.

### Example:
```python
# Retrieve values for specific fields from the Model
values = MyModel.objects.values('field1', 'field2')

# Iterate over the queryset and access the field values
for value in values:
    print(value['field1'], value['field2'])
```

In the above example, `MyModel` is the Django model you're working with, and `'field1'` and `'field2'` are the specific fields for which you want to retrieve the values. The result will be a QuerySet of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains the values for the specified fields.

## 2. Values List

The `values_list()` method is similar to `values()`, but it returns a QuerySet of tuples instead of dictionaries. Each tuple represents an object, and its elements correspond to the specified fields.

### Example:
```python
# Retrieve values for specific fields from the Model as tuples
values_list = MyModel.objects.values_list('field1', 'field2')

# Iterate over the queryset and access the field values
for value_tuple in values_list:
    print(value_tuple[0], value_tuple[1])
```

In this example, `values_list()` is used instead of `values()`, and it returns a QuerySet of tuples containing the values for the specified fields.
