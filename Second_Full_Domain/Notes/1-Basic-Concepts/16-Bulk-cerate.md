# Bulk Create

The `bulk_create` method allows you to create multiple objects in a single database query, which can be more efficient than creating them one by one. Here's how you can use it:

```python
# Assuming you have a model called MyModel with fields 'field1' and 'field2'
# Create a list of MyModel objects
objects_to_create = [
    MyModel(field1='value1', field2='value2'),
    MyModel(field1='value3', field2='value4'),
    # Add more objects as needed
]

# Use bulk_create to create all objects in a single query
MyModel.objects.bulk_create(objects_to_create)
```

In the example above, you define a list of `MyModel` objects with the desired field values. Then, you pass this list to the `bulk_create` method of the `MyModel.objects` manager, which performs a single query to create all the objects in the database.

It's important to note that the `bulk_create` method bypasses the Django model's `save()` method, so any pre-save or post-save signals, as well as any model-specific logic, will not be triggered. Additionally, the method does not return the created objects' primary keys since those are generated by the database upon insertion.

Keep in mind that using `bulk_create` can be more efficient when creating a large number of objects at once, but it may not be suitable for every use case. Consider the trade-offs between efficiency and any necessary model-specific operations before using `bulk_create`.
