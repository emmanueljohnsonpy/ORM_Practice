# Django ORM - Q Object

In Django's ORM (Object-Relational Mapping), a 'Q object' refers to a powerful tool that allows you to
construct complex queries by combining multiple conditions using logical operators. The 'Q' stands for
query. With 'Q objects,' you can perform advanced database lookups by chaining together conditions
such as AND, OR, and NOT. This feature is particularly useful when you need to build dynamic queries
based on user input or when you want to express complex filters on your database models.

To use 'Q objects,' you first need to import the Q class from the `django.db.models` module. Here's
an example of how you can use 'Q objects' in Django:

```python
from django.db.models import Q

# Retrieve all books published in 2021 and authored by John
books = Book.objects.filter(Q(publication_year=2021) & Q(author='John'))

# Retrieve all books published in 2021 or authored by John
books = Book.objects.filter(Q(publication_year=2021) | Q(author='John'))

# Retrieve all books not published in 2021
books = Book.objects.filter(~Q(publication_year=2021))
```

In the examples above, the Q objects are combined using logical operators such as & (AND), | (OR),
and ~ (NOT) to construct complex queries. These queries can be used with the `filter()` method of a
Django model to retrieve the desired results from the database.
