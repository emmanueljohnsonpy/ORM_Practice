# F and FO Objects in Django ORM

In Django ORM (Object-Relational Mapping), the terms `F` and `FO` refer to expressions used for database queries and updates. Both `F` and `FO` objects provide a convenient way to perform database operations using the values of model fields. They can be used in filters, updates, annotations, and other query operations within the Django ORM.

## 1. F Objects

`F` objects allow you to reference model field values within queries. They represent the value of a model field and can be used in various query operations. `F` objects are useful when you want to perform operations between fields or compare a field value with another field value in the same model.

<!-- For example, suppose you have a model called `Product` with fields `price` and `discount`. You can use an `F` object to calculate the final price after applying the discount as follows: -->

```python
from django.db.models import F

products = Product.objects.filter(price__gt=F('discount'))
```

In this example, `F('discount')` represents the value of the `discount` field for each product, and `price__gt=F('discount')` filters the products where the price is greater than the discount.

## 2. FO Objects

`FO` object is just an informal or shorthand way to refer to F() objects when you're performing arithmetic operations between model fields.

For example, suppose you have a model called `Product` with fields `price` and `discount`. You can use an `FO` object to calculate the final price by subtracting the discount from the price:

```python
from django.db.models import F, ExpressionWrapper, DecimalField

products = Product.objects.annotate(
    final_price=ExpressionWrapper(F('price') - F('discount'), output_field=DecimalField())
)
```

This involves `F() objects`, but the term `FO object` is simply shorthand to describe this concept in a more casual manner. So, in Django, `FO (Field Object)` and `F()` object refer to the same thing.
