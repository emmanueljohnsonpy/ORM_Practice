# Abstract User and Abstract Base User

In Django's object-relational mapping (ORM), the terms **AbstractUser** and **AbstractBaseUser** refer to two different base classes that can be used for creating custom user models. Both `AbstractUser` and `AbstractBaseUser` provide a foundation for creating custom user models in Django, but `AbstractUser` is more suitable for most cases where you need a user model with common fields, while `AbstractBaseUser` offers greater flexibility but requires more manual implementation.

## AbstractUser

`AbstractUser` is a built-in Django class that provides a concrete implementation of the User model. It is a subclass of the `AbstractBaseUser` class. The `AbstractUser` class includes common fields and methods that are typically associated with user authentication and management, such as `username`, `password`, `email`, `first_name`, `last_name`, etc. By using `AbstractUser`, you can create a user model that already includes these common fields and methods.

Here's an example of how you can create a custom user model using `AbstractUser`:

```python
from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractUser

class CustomUser(AbstractUser):
    # Add any additional fields or methods specific to your user model
    pass
```

## AbstractBaseUser

`AbstractBaseUser` is another built-in Django class that provides a more flexible base for creating custom user models. It is an abstract class that you can inherit from to create a completely custom user model. When using `AbstractBaseUser`, you have to define the fields and methods yourself based on your specific requirements.

Here's an example of how you can create a custom user model using `AbstractBaseUser`:

```python
from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractBaseUser, BaseUserManager

class CustomUserManager(BaseUserManager):
    # Define your custom user manager
    pass

class CustomUser(AbstractBaseUser):
    # Define your custom user model fields
    pass

    objects = CustomUserManager()
```

In the example above, you need to define a custom user manager (e.g., `CustomUserManager`) that inherits from `BaseUserManager` and implement any necessary methods for user creation, authentication, etc. Then, the custom user model (e.g., `CustomUser`) should inherit from `AbstractBaseUser` and define the necessary fields for your user model.
